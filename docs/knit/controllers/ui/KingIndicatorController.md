# KingIndicatorController

### Description

	KingIndicatorController
	
	Displays the new king. The text flies in if there hasn't been a new king in CURRENT_KING_DURATION.
	If the text is already on the screen when there's a new king, it instead pumps its size temporarily
	as a visual indication of the new king.
